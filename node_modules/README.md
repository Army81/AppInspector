__NOTE__: The `node_modules/` folder is not included in the repository.


# How do I get the dependecies?

If you are forking this repository for the first time, please run 

```
npm install
```

from the project root folder.


# How do I add new dependencies?

If you need to add a new module, please use the

```
npm install *modulename* --save-dev
```

command from the project root folder to add it to `package.json`.


# Someone changed/added modules! What to do?
 
If changes have been made to the `package.json` file either by adding a new module or if a dependency has been updated, you only need to run

```
npm update
```

from the project root folder to update.

This will update all `node_modules` to the latest version and also install missing packages.
