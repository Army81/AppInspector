<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/app-inspector-for-sencha/pbeapidedgdpniokbedbfbaacglkceae">![Available on Chrome Store](https://developers.google.com/chrome/web-store/images/branding/ChromeWebStore_BadgeWBorder_v2_206x58.png)</a>

## Features

* Creates a new section on Dev Tools elements panel displaying properties of a given component if they match the selected DOM node.
* Creates a new Sencha panel with a variety of debugging utilities for the Sencha Touch and Ext JS frameworks
 
## Architecture
This Chrome extension has 3 pieces:

* background: a page that works on the background and coordinates communication between tabs and the inspector
* devtools: bootstrap the dev tools extension, adding panels on the element tab and the new Sencha tab
* inspector: the App Inspector itself. It's rendered in an iframe inside dev tools

## Known Issues
There are some APIs from Dev Tools that are not fully exposed, so the App Inspector uses some work arounds:

* Component highlighting is executed manually via CSS
* DOM modifications (add/remove/move components) do not reflect automatically on the App Inspector, which is why we have "reload" buttons.

## Contributing
This is a community project, so feel free to fork it. Pull requests with bug fixes and new features are welcomed!

The UI for the Sencha panel is built using:

* Sencha Architect 3.x
* Sencha Ext JS 4.2.x
* Sencha Cmd 4.x

 * Run **npm install** to install all Node.js dependencies from *package.json*
 * If you are building the project for the first time, be sure to open the Architect project and hit "save" to generate the necessary Sencha Cmd bits
