Chrome Dev Tools extension for debugging Sencha applications.

This is a great tool to debug your Sencha Application. It allows you to better understand the component tree and get yourself
oriented faster.

Features
--------
 - Creates a new section on Dev Tools elements panel displaying properties of a given component if they match the selected DOM node.
 - Creates a new Sencha Panel displaying the component tree
 - Hovering the component tree will highlight the component on the screen
 - You can use the keyboard to navigate trough the component tree

Known Issues
------------
Component highlighting is executed by injecting a &lt;div&gt; into the page. We're trying to use the same approach of dev tools.

Since debugging the Sencha Panel is difficult, you can switch InspectorWindow.js by InspectorWindowMockup.js. This is the only
part that depends on the Chrome Dev Tools shell. All the rest is pure HTML, CSS & JS. After switching this file you can open
inspector.html and debug with Dev Tools itself.
